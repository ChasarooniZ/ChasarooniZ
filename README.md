### Hi there ✨
You probably know me from my foundry modules, I'm Chasarooni, and here is a list of all the modules I am currently maintaining. Without further ado, my modules:

- 🐉[**PF2e RPG Numbers & More**](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-rpg-numbers). A module that adds a host of neat visual effects for the PF2e system. Covers a different use case than modules like Graphics and AA, in that most of these animations aren't specific to an item or action, but just general animatons (IE the Damage Numbers) etc.
