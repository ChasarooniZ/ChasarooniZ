### Hi there ✨
You probably know me from my foundry modules, I'm Chasarooni, and here is a list of all the modules I am currently maintaining. Also you can reach out to me via github issue, if for some reason I don't see them you can reach out to me on the pf2e fvtt discord. Without further ado, my modules:

- [Genga](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/genga). System agnostic animations, also functions as a library modules for RPG Numbers
- [PF2e RPG Numbers & More](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-rpg-numbers). A module that adds a host of neat visual effects for the PF2e system. Covers a different use case than modules like Graphics and AA, in that most of these animations aren't specific to an item or action, but just general animatons (IE the Damage Numbers) etc.
- [PF2e Item Activations](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-item-activations). A module to handle PF2e items that have a **Activation.** pairs nicely with Usage Updater
